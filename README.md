*Folders:*
- code: contains R (.R) and R markdown (.Rmd) files. Running these reads in data from "raw_data" folder, generates intermediate results in "int_data folder" that are also used in the code, and generates final results in "results" folder. 

*Raw Data:*
- FAOStat
-- Fertilizer N use per ha of cropland - downloaded 04/21/2023. Units are kg N/ha. FAO metadata indicates values are "the ratio between the totals by nutrient of agricultural use of chemical or mineral fertilizers, reported in the FAOSTAT domain “Inputs/Fertilizers by Nutrient” for nitrogen (N)...and the area of cropland reported in the FAOSTAT domain “Inputs/Land Use”"
-- Fertilizer N Agricultural Use  - downloaded 04/21/2023. Units are tonnes nutrient nitrogen (N).\
-- fert_use_emissions.csv - Total emissions from synthetic fertilizer application. Downloaded 04/21/2023 from https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT, selecting "Synthetic Fertilizers" and "Emissions (CO2eq) (AR5)". Original units are kilotonnes (gigagrams) CO2e

*int_data/qgis_output* 
- Contains files generated by QGIS analysis of MAPSPAM and Searchinger carbon storage data. Data is aggregated by crop and country, with one spreadsheet for each crop. Values represent the total vegetation and soil carbon content in native vegetation that cropland expanded into from 2000 to 2010, and the change in physical area from 2000 to 2010 for that crop in hectares. The change in physical area only accounts for croland expansion; we convert negative land-use change values to 0, thereby assuming no land abandonment.

*Code:* 
First, run calculate_calories_per_cropland.Rmd
- We omit all country-crop combinations lacking complete data (where there are any NAs in the time frame). We then convert total crop production (in tons) from all countries from 1961-2017 to kilocalories, using FAO's nutritive factors. We then calculate kilocalories per hectare, a measure of total yields by country. This is used in the regression analysis.
INPUT: FAOSTAT_production_all_crops.csv, cal_per_tonne_by_crop.csv, FAOSTAT_Cropland.csv
OUTPUT: prod.cropland.csv

Second, run World_CarbonLoss.rmd
- Reads in total vegetation and soil carbon (in tonnes C) that was in native vegation converted to cropland, by crop and country, generated from QGIS analysis of 2000 and 2010 MAPSPAM and Searchinger carbon storage data, as well as LUC (in hectares) for that time period. The script calculates total, and individual soil and vegetation CO2 loss per hectare for each crop by country (crop- and country-specific emissions factors). It calculates two versions of the potential soil CO2 loss per hectare, using 25% loss (Houghton) and 40% loss
- INPUT: crop-specific xlsx files in int_data/qgis_output
- OUTPUT: LUC_CO2_crops.csv

Third, run land_demand.R
Reads in the Future of Food and Agriculture report's (FAO Global Perspectives database) projections of crop production from 2012-2050 for all countries to construct model scenarios; calculates harvested area, arable land, and yields for the baseline, projected, and high yield scenarios. Using crop- and country-specific emissions factors, calculates lower and upper estimates of LUC and LUC emissions for each scenario for each African country and then aggregates by region.
INPUT: FOFA2050CountryData_Crop-production 7.csv, cal_per_tonne_by_crop.csv World_CO2_loss.csv
OUTPUT:regions_scenario_dan.csv, LUC_tot_region_dan.csv

*Results:*
Includes graphs and tables generated by code.

*Misc*
- Calc LUC_EnergyAg: contains files with MAPSPAM tifs and .qgzs, GHG_emis.csv files, and searchinger.asc and .qgz files. Use unsure. 

- Energy-Ag: All files are from Feb 10, 2020 and so are presumed obsolete.
